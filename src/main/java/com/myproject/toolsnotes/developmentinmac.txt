 bash profile vs zprofie

 both are same

 mac by defauly has bash installed in it version 3.2.57(1)-release

 bash --version   --> it will give you the version

 to change the shell from zsh to bash, go to systemPreferences, Users, select users, click and select user, advanced options and change the shell there
 once you change there, also change from command prompt
 chsh -s /usr/local/bin/bash

 add the same in the path as well in .bash_profile
 export JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home)
 export PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/cof/bin:/bin:/sbin:/usr/sbin:/usr/libexec:/Applications/apache-maven-3.6.3/bin:/usr/local/opt/python/libexec/bin:/usr/bin
